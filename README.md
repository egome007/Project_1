PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

Research of crime statistics for five major cities within Los Angeles County and analyze the correlation of residential burglaries which occur at a specific time of day and how it compares to same time on different days. 

RESEARCH QUESTIONS TO ANSWER:

+	What is the burglary rate for each of the five major cities?
+	What time of day did the burglary occur in each of the five major cities?
+	Is there a trend for what time of day burglaries occur?
+	Does this trend change across the five major cities?

DATASETS INCLUDED:

TASKS / MILESTONES
Day 1
•	Decompose the ask (Consider the interpretations of the terms and how that influences collection and analysis, Is the scope manageable and reasonable for adding value to the question)
•	Identify the Data Sources 
•	Define the strategy and metrics (Create the blueprint for the data being targeted, e.g.How many cities, random sampling) 
•	Build data retrieval plan (Yelp Fusion for querying the API, Python script to randomly select 700 US cities) 
Day 2
•	Retrieve the data 
•	Assemble and validate the data 
•	Analyze for trends 
•	Acknowledge limitations
DELIVERABLES

1.	GitHub repository
2.	Project documentation with code samples
3.	Final presentation
 

Development Requirements		
		
	Use Pandas to clean and format your dataset(s). 
	Create a Jupyter Notebook describing the data exploration and cleanup process.
	Create a Jupyter Notebook illustrating the final data analysis. 
	Use Matplotlib to create a total of 6–8 visualizations of your data (ideally, at least 2 per ”question” you ask of your data). 
	Save PNG images of your visualizations to distribute to the class and instructional team, and for inclusion in your presentation. 
	(Optional) Use at least one API, if you can find an API with data pertinent to your primary research questions. 
	Create a write-up summarizing your major findings. This should include a heading for each “question” you asked of your data and a short description of your findings and any relevant plots.
		
Presentation Requirements		
Prepare a formal, 10-minute presentation that covers	
		
	Questions you found interesting and what motivated you to answer them
	Where and how you found the data you used to answer these questions
	The data exploration and cleanup process (accompanied by your Jupyter Notebook)
	The analysis process (accompanied by your Jupyter Notebook)
	Your conclusions, which should include a numerical summary and visualizations of that summary
	The implications of your findings: what do your findings mean?
